// entrypoint for our cluster which will make workers
// and the workers will do the Socket.io handling
// Instead of starting the node.js server on that port and listening in each worker, 
// we need to introduce a tiny proxy layer to make sure that connections from the same host end up in the same worker.
// The way to do this is to create a single server listening on port 3000 and consistently map source IP addresses to our workers. 
// We then pass the connection to the worker, which emits a connection event on its server. 
// To prevent data loss where data is sent on the connection before it has been passed to the worker, the server sets the pauseOnConnect option.
// That way, connections are paused immediately and workers can .resume() them to receive data when they're ready. Processing then proceeds as normal:
